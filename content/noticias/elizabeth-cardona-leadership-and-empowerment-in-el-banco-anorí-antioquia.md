Elizabeth is a 36-year-old woman born in Medellín. She currently lives in the village of El Banco in Anorí, Antioquia. She is a leader with a strong spirit who created a women's group with which she started a productive and local savings project for the benefit of her community. However, her efforts did not end there.  

In 2022, Elizabeth actively participated in the Self Organized Learning Environments (SOLE) meetings, becoming an ambassador of these spaces that contribute to closing the digital divide and promote collaborative learning using computers and the internet. Today, she is a reference point and promoter of this initiative in her territory, having managed to bring her neighbors together to solve “big questions”1 with the aid of technology. “This is how we achieve more equitable and connected communities”, she says. "Now I know that with the internet I can learn and teach others, I feel happy," she adds.

Elizabeth also participated in the Nonviolent Communication Schools, promoted by USAID’s Weaving Lives and Hope, and has facilitated three replication-workshops of this strategy with the Anorí’s Victims Participation Board, and with ORVIDA, a grass-root organization for armed-conflict victims.  

According to her, participating in Weaving Lives and Hope’s different components has been, very gratifying for her. "It helped me to empower myself, to trust in myself. Rediscover my history, and to motivate me to work for my community". Her time in the program allowed her to recognize her abilities as a leader, which led her to form a group of women called Siempre Vivas (Always Alive), that seeks to improve their families’ income by making handicrafts. She is currently a benchmark of leadership and community advocacy.
